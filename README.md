# webscraping-challenge

## Description:
This project involves web scraping and data analysis of Mars-related information. The goal is to scrape both Mars news articles and weather data, analyze the collected data, and visualize the insights. This repository contains the code and documentation for two main deliverables:

1. Scraping Mars News Articles: Extract titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
2. Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data: Scrape weather data from an HTML table and perform data analysis.

## Deliverables
### Deliverable 1: Mars News Articles
- Objective: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
- Tools Used: Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing.
- Outcome: A list of news article titles and their preview text.

### Deliverable 2: Mars Weather Data
- Objective: Scrape weather data from a table and analyze it.
- Tools Used: Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Outcome: Analysis of Mars weather data, including:
    - Determining the number of Earth days in a Martian year.
    - Visualizing temperature data over time.
